# Endless-Runner-Game
My first game in Unity
### I created a 3D ENDLESS RUNNER in Unity following Jimmy Vegas' tutorial [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1b66Z1KFKit4cSry_LWBisrSbVkEF4t). The aim of the game is to collect as many points as possible, achieve the shortest time and avoid obstacles.

### To make this game I went through beginner tutorials on YouTube and searched github for example implementations. This project was created using Unity version 2021.3 and Visual Studio 2022 IDE.
